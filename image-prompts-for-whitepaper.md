# Image Generation Prompts for White Paper

Generate these 6 images to complete the white paper visualization.

## IMAGE 1: Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Response Comparison

Create a split-screen technical diagram showing two security systems side by side. LEFT SIDE: "Deterministic System" with a simple flowchart showing Attack A, B, C all leading to the same Response X with straight arrows, labeled "Predictable Pattern". RIGHT SIDE: "Non-Deterministic System" with Attack A, B, C branching into multiple different responses (X, Y, Z, W) with chaotic, interweaving paths and entropy symbols (dice, chaos symbols), labeled "Unpredictable Chaos". Use cybersecurity color scheme: dark blue background, neon green for non-deterministic paths, red for deterministic paths. Include small icons for attacks (shield with X, bug, lock) and responses (encrypted file, warning, checkmark). Professional, technical illustration style.

## IMAGE 2: Chaos Theory Butterfly Effect in Security Responses

Create an artistic visualization of the butterfly effect applied to security. Show a small butterfly labeled "Initial Attack" on the left side, with its wings creating ripples that transform into increasingly complex, fractal-like patterns spreading across the image. The patterns should morph from simple geometric shapes into intricate, chaotic security-themed elements: encrypted locks, shields, warning symbols, data streams. Use a gradient from purple/blue on the left to vibrant neon colors on the right. Include mathematical formulas subtly in the background (entropy equations, chaos theory symbols). The overall effect should show how small changes in attack sequence create vastly different outcomes. Abstract, modern, scientific illustration style with a dark background.

## IMAGE 3: Permutation Space Visualization - Finite vs Infinite

Create a 3D technical diagram comparing two spaces. BOTTOM/FRONT: "Traditional System" showing a small, contained cube with 10 dots connected by straight lines, labeled "10 Mappings - Finite Space". TOP/BACK: "Non-Deterministic System" showing an exploding, infinite-looking space with thousands of interconnected nodes spreading outward like a galaxy, labeled "3,628,800+ Permutations × Entropy = Infinite Space". Use perspective to show depth. Traditional space in dull gray/red, non-deterministic space in vibrant purple/blue with glowing connections. Include axis labels: "Attack Sequences", "Entropy", "Responses". Add small text: "Unmappable by Attackers". Professional 3D technical visualization with dark space background and glowing elements.

## IMAGE 4: SEO Crawl Trap to Security Analogy Diagram

Create a side-by-side comparison diagram with two parallel systems. LEFT: "SEO Crawl Trap" showing a web crawler (spider icon) trying to navigate an infinite maze of URL paths (/page?sort=asc&filter=1, /page?sort=desc&filter=2, etc.) with the spider getting lost in endless permutations. RIGHT: "Security Anti-Tamper" showing a hacker icon trying to navigate an identical maze structure but with security attack sequences ([A,B,C], [A,C,B], [B,A,C], etc.). Both mazes should be identical in structure to show the parallel. Use web-themed colors (blue/green) for SEO side, security-themed colors (red/purple) for security side. Include arrows showing "Legitimate User" bypassing the maze easily on both sides. Clean, modern infographic style with icons and clear labels.

## IMAGE 5: Attack Sequence Flow with Multiple Response Paths

Create a complex flowchart showing attack sequences branching into multiple responses. START at top with "Attacker Initiates" icon. Show three initial attacks (TPM Extract, Memory Dump, Debugger) branching downward. Each attack leads to multiple possible second attacks, creating a tree structure. From each branch point, show different colored paths leading to various responses (Silent Corruption, Honey Data, Exponential Delay, Chaos Mode, Do Nothing). Use different colors for each response type. Add entropy symbols (dice, random number generators) at each decision point. Include a "Sophistication Detector" gauge on the side showing how response changes based on attacker skill. Use a dark background with neon-colored paths (cyan, magenta, yellow, green). Technical flowchart style with cyberpunk aesthetic.

## IMAGE 6: Attacker's Perspective - Confusion Matrix Visualization

Create a first-person perspective view from an attacker's screen showing their confusion. Show a terminal/hacker interface with multiple windows displaying contradictory results. Window 1: "Attack Log" showing same attack sequence tried 3 times with 3 different responses. Window 2: "Pattern Analysis" showing error messages "NO PATTERN DETECTED", "BEHAVIOR UNPREDICTABLE". Window 3: Graph showing chaos - a scatter plot with no discernible pattern, labeled "Response Mapping Failed". Window 4: Timer showing "Time Wasted: 47 hours". Include frustrated hacker silhouette in foreground (back of head/shoulders) looking at screens. Use green terminal text on black background, red error messages, blue graphs. Realistic hacker workspace aesthetic with multiple monitors, dark room, code on screens. Cinematic, dramatic lighting from screens.
